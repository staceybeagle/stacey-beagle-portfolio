     <h1>Introduction</h1>
     <p>I am a former college instructor and current stay-at-home mother to two amazing girls, aged 7 and 9.  Now that my daughters are growing up, I'm ready to start my second career in Front-End Development.
     <br></br>
     I first became interested in web development when I started my own blog.  I used WordPress as a starting point for my website, but soon became frustrated with my inability to personalize it exactly how I wanted to.  So I began to teach myself HTML, CSS, PHP and Java.  I was soon completely hooked and now spend my time coding while my kids are at school! </p>

    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>I'm a California girl!  I was raised in Petaluma, California where I grew up with small-town suburban values in one of the most beautiful places in the state.  I have since settled in Roseville, California where I have the ocean two hours to the west, and the mountains two hours east.  
      <br></br>
    Roseville is a town located just east of Sacramento.  It's a perfect place to raise my girls because I can still offer them the same small-town values I grew up with but also expose them to the benefits of city living.
    <br></br>
    Because I was born and bred as a California girl, California is most likely where I am going to stay.  However, once I reach my golden years I'm heading a bit farther east to live in the mountains!</p>

  <h1>More About Me</h1>
  <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
  <p class="answer">I <span>LOVE</span> to read!  My older daughter and I just started reading Harry Potter together.  I feel like I am the only person on earth who hasn't read Harry Potter or seen the movie!</p>
    <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
    <p>My dream job is something that is flexible enough for me to spend as much time as possible with my family yet challenges me and intrigues me enough to look forward to working every day.</p>
    <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
  <p class="answer3"> <span> 90's</span> throwback!  Lately I've been reminiscing and grooving to a lot of music from when I was in high school.  Good times.</p>
